# Magisk on VMOS
Magisk successfully installed on VMOS - but Magisk can't work properly

***Only MagiskSU. This is a experimental feature. If you want modules then don't expect it to work. Modules like MigiskHideProps are not working. So don't expect much.â€‹***

***As of now there is no working way for passing SafetyNet for playing games and apps that use it.***

Hi guy, finally I installed Magisk on VMOS successfully!! Magisk daemon can be running but it can't work properly maybe due to VM limitations.
The newer Magisk (22.0+) app can't detect installed Magisk.

But I can grant MagiskSU (make a Superuser request)... Only MagiskSu works

I have made a script to install Magisk as VMOS Tool Terminal modification on VMOS. NOTE that Magisk on VMOS cannot work properly and it is for TEST only!!!

Magisk mount folder: `/sbin/magiskimg`

### How to install Magisk for VMOS Pro

***The installation without boot.img patching. Magisk is installed into VM directly***

VMOS doesn't have `boot.img`, it actually uses the same `/dev` and `/proc` of physical machine (your device).

This is unstable build, so it cannot work properly at all!!

Magisk may not work on your ROM, depend on your fortunateness.

6. Reboot the virtual machine.

If you want to remove Magisk or switch back to Koush Superuser, just flash mod again!!!

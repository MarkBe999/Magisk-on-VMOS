# Magisk on VMOS
Magisk successfully installed on VMOS - but Magisk can't work properly

***Only MagiskSU. Unfortunately, VMOS doesn't have SeLinux (its SeLinux always be permissive) so MagiskHide cannot hide root and Magisk module cannot work. This is a experimental feature. If you want modules then don't expect it to work. Modules like MigiskHideProps are not working. So don't expect much.â€‹***

***As of now there is no working way for passing SafetyNet for playing games and apps that use it.***

**No benefit of replacing old root with Magisk**

Hi guy, finally I installed Magisk on VMOS successfully!! Magisk daemon can be running but it can't work properly maybe due to VM limitations.
The newer Magisk (22.0+) app can't detect installed Magisk. 

## Why doesn't Magisk work properly in VMOS?

Because SeLinux always be permissive or disabled, any third-party apps can get root access without prompted. **IT IS VERY DANGEROUS!!!!**

You cannot change SeLinux in VMOS to **Enforcing** by `setenforce 1`

VMOS doesn't have `boot.img`, it actually uses the same `/dev` and `/proc` of physical machine (your device).

This is unstable build, so it cannot work properly at all!!

Magisk may not work on your ROM, depend on your fortunateness.

But I can grant MagiskSU (make a Superuser request)... But when I press **GRANT** button, Terminal doesn't show anything, I cannot type and call any command after that!

NEW!! Magisk Manager v.8.0.0 can detect installed Magisk.

I have made a script to install Magisk as VMOS Tool Terminal modification on VMOS. NOTE that Magisk on VMOS cannot work properly and it is for TEST only!!!

Magisk fake boot: `/.boot/magisk`

### How to install Magisk for VMOS Pro

***The installation without boot.img patching. Magisk is installed into VM directly***

If you want to remove Magisk or switch back to Koush Superuser, just flash mod again!!!
